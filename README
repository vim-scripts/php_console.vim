This is a mirror of http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=779

This is for windows.

For unix see http://vim.sourceforge.net/scripts/script.php?script_id=326.
(But you can adapt this also for unix. Just the path-reference to the php.exe is different.)

Go into your php-file and :call ParsePhpFile().

Write a mapping to automat this. E.g. 
map <F5> :call ParsePhpFile()<cr>
imap <F5> <esc>:call ParsePhpFile()<cr>

Now you can debug your php-file without leaving vim. 

You can jump to the error lines by clicking on the compiler output in the window that opens below.

After finishing removing the errors you can open your php-file in the browser.

Advantages:
* You do not rely on apache. This means:
* You can open the php-files everywhere in the filesystem (also outside of htdocs).
* There is no difference between the console and the browser output. (When there is no error output you see the normal html output.)
* Roundtrip error checking is possible without leaving vim.
